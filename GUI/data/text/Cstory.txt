In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.
_
One Sunday morning the warm sun came up and -pop! -out of the egg
came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar.
_
He started to look for some food.
_
On Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream 
cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one 
lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one 
slice of watermelon.
_
He built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself. He stayed inside 
for more than two weeks. Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his 
way out and
_
He was a beautiful butterfly!
