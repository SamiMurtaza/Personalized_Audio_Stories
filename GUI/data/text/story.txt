Olive the turtle snuggled onto his favorite rock underwater. His little head, beady
eyes and glossy olive green shell shone brightly as the moonlight lit up his home. 
With his lungs filled with air, his tummy full of jellyfish and shrimps, his
favorite food, he was ready to sleep for the night
_
As Olive was dozing off, he remembered what his friend Dibby the dolphin had said 
that morning "Beware of the plogres!" said Dibby to everyone "Who are de Plogres?" 
asked Dunga the dugong. Plogres are plastic monsters. I choked on a bottle cap 
Proger when I was eating breakfast. It looked like squid, my favourite food," 
replied Dibby sadly

Olive did not sleep well that night. He dreamt of Progres - crumpled, coloured 
plastic bag Progres, candy wrapper Postgres, straw Progres, bottle Progres and 
broken fishing net plogres. It was a terrible sight indeed.

The next morning Olive woke up feeling tired and sad. He didn't feel hungry and 
worried about those dreadful plogrel. As he went up to fill his lungs with air 
he met his friends Dibby, Olly and Dunga seek who were getting ready for a game 
of hide and It was a beautiful sunny day,"Come on Olive. Join us," said Olly the 
octopus cheerfully, as she waved her eight arms around as if dancing in the sunlight.
Dibby the dolphins coat sparkled as the sun shone on him. Seeing his friends made 
Olive feel happier. "I'll be right back," he said and he forgot all about his bad 
dream. Dunga the dugong, with his large body and shark like tail,counted from one 
to hundred, as everyone else swam off to hide Ready or not here I come" called out 
Dunga.
